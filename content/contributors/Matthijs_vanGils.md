description_short: "Transformed into an AI enthusiast during my Master's in Marketing Analytics, I'm now leveraging this new passion to share knowledge and insights about helpful AI tools for students and teachers through Tilburg.ai."
description_long: "At Tilburg Science Hub, I mainly focus on Tilburg.ai, a site that makes education more efficient for students and teachers, by using cool AI tools. My main job at Tilburg.ai is writing articles. But, as a marketing student, I'm also excited about making this site more popular. The best part of working at Tilburg Science Hub for me is that you get lots of responsibility and the freedom to make your own choices and strategies. Of course, you need to back up your ideas. But, with these responsibilities, it really feels like you're running your own business, which is really cool!"
