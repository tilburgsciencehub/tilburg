## Overview

This is a template for a reproducible [Dockerized](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/automate-and-execute-your-work/reproducible-work/docker/) application, based on [R](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/configure-your-computer/statistics-and-computation/r/), that **finds keywords and/or sentences in multiple `PDF` files**.

{{% summary %}}
* We use `R` to first, convert the `PDF` files into plain text files (`.txt`).
* Then, a second `R` script searches the keywords and/or sentences that are previously defined in those converted text files.
* Matches are reported into an Excel file, reporting what keyword or sentence was found in which file.

`Docker` is used to run the above mentioned process inside an isolated container (*see [this building block](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/configure-your-computer/automation-and-workflows/docker/) to learn more about containers*). By doing so, you can run this application without even having to have `R` installed in your computer plus it will also run smoothly, regardless of what operating system (OS) you're using.  



## Motivating Example
In many situations, we make use of `crtl (or "Command" in Mac) + F` to find words or sentences in `PDF` files. However, this can be highly time-consuming, especially if needed to apply in multiple files and/or different keywords or sentences. For instance, we first applied this application in legal research, where we needed to check in over 10,000 court rulings, which ones made reference to a specific law.
