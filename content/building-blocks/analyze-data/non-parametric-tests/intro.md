## Overview

Performing statistical tests like t-test and f-test are imperative in any empirical study to help test the hypotheses about population parameters. However, parametric tests like these make certain assumptions about the underlying population distribution which are not always reasonable to make.

Imagine you're comparing the heights of two groups of people: Group A and Group B. You want to know if Group A is taller, on average, than Group B.

In a perfect world, where everything follows a bell-shaped curve (a normal distribution), you could use a parametric test like the t-test. This test assumes that the data is normally distributed and that the variances of the two groups are equal.

</p>

Now, let's say you measure the heights of both groups, but your data doesn't look like a nice, symmetric bell curve as above . Instead, the data is kind of all over the place, and you're not sure if the variances are equal. Hence, in such a case, one should use a non-parametric test instead

In situations where the distribution of the sample is unknown, using a parametric test like the t-test might not be appropriate because it relies on those assumptions.
So, you should instead turn to non-parametric tests. These tests don't make as many assumptions about the shape of the data. They work by ranking the data points and comparing those ranks, rather than looking at the raw data values.

In this building block, we will describe the various non-parametric test that you can use according to the data sample you have.


## Which test to use?
Determining which statistical test is most appropriate depends on 3 characteristics of your data:

- Measurement scale
  - Nominal / Categorical scale
      - Categorizes data into distinct groups or categories without any inherent order or numerical value.
      - Example: Gender, colour
  - Ordinal / Ranking scale
      - Orders or ranks data based on their relative position or preference without making precise statements about the magnitude of the differences between them.      
      - Example: Grades, Valuations        
  - Interval (Cardinal) scale
      - Categorizes data into distinct groups or levels, and the differences between these categories are meaningful and consistent
      - Example: Temperature, Calendar dates
  - Ratio scale
      - This is the highest level of measurement scale that possesses all the characteristics of nominal, ordinal, and interval scales, and in addition, it has a true zero point that represents the absence of the measured attribute.

- Type of data
  - Binary
  - Discrete
  - Continuous

- Data structure
  - **One sample**: Single observation from a single subject group
  - **Two (or more) dependent samples**: Multiple observations from a single subject group
  - **Two (or more) independent samples**: Multiple observations from several independent subject groups

## Types of non parametric tests
Now that you know the characteristics of your sample, you can accordingly choose the most appropriate non parametric test

### Binomial Test
If you are dealing with a **binary data** with a **nominal** measurement scale, binomial test is the most appropriate test. It answers the question: "Is the observed outcome significantly different from what we would expect by a random chance?"; such as: Testing if a coin is fair, testing if a an election outcome favours the Republican or the Democrats, etc.



### Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit
Another test you can use with a **binary** and **nominal** data is the Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit. It tests whether a significant difference exists between an observed number of outcomes falling in each category and an expected number based on the null hypothesis (which we call the goodness-of-fit)

{{% warning %}}
The two tests discussed above are useful when you only have **one sample** of data. However, when there are multiple samples of data, it is important to be mindful if those data samples are independent or if they are related to each other. You should accordingly choose the most apt test.

## Two dependent samples

### Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed Ranks Test
This test is suitable for **ordinal** and **discrete** data, as well as **continuous** data.
But before going over the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Sign Test, let's first discuss another non-parametric test called the *Sign Test*. This test can be interpreted as an application of the Binomial Test in case of two dependent samples (generally a case of 'before' and 'after' treatment), with n observations. Each pair of the observation can be put into three classes:

**+** = 'before' measurement is **greater/better** than the 'after' treatment

**0** = 'before' measurement is **equal/same** as 'after' treatment

**-** = 'before' measurement is **smaller/worse** than the 'after' treatment

The Sign Test, however, only accounts for the sign of the differences between the two dependent samples and not for the magnitude of the difference. Hence, the **Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test** serves as a **powerful extension** of the Sign test as it uses both the sign and relative magnitude (ranks) of the differences.



### McNemar's test
The final test suitable for two dependent samples is the McNemar's Test. It is suitable for **nominal** and **discrete** data. It's often used in situations where you have two sets of observations, like before and after measurements or two different treatments on the same group.

Let's say you're testing a new drug to see if it's effective in treating a medical condition. You have a group of 100 patients who are all currently using an existing treatment (Treatment A). You administer the new drug (Treatment B) to these patients and observe the outcomes after a period of time. You record the results in a 2x2 table like this:


|             |               | **Treatment B** |               |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
|             |               | Improved| Not improved    |     
| **Treatment A** | Improved | 20      | 15            |
|             | Not improved | 10        | 55        |


In this case, each patient serves as their own control because they receive both treatments, A and B. Their responses are paired directly with themselves, making the observations dependent.

The McNemar's test helps answer the question: "Is there a significant difference in improvement rates between the two treatments?"



{{% warning %}}
The tests above deal with a **within subject** design in which all participants take part in every condition (treatment), making the observations dependent on each other. However, many experiments tend to have a **between subject** design where each participant experiences only one of the treatments. As a result, the decisions made in the two (or more) treatments are **independent** of each other.

Let's discuss the tests suitable for this setting:

## Two independent samples

### Fisher's Exact test
This test is suitable for analysing **discrete** and **nominal** data, with two independent samples that fall into two distinct classes.
Hence, the data can be expressed as a 2x2 as such,

|             |      **Class 1**         | **Class 2** |               |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Sample 1**|     A          |     B        | A + B    |
| **Sample 2**  | C       | D          |  C + D    |
|              | A + C          | B + D      |    N = A + B + C + D    |


The Fisher's Exact test tries to determine whether there is statistically significant relationship between the **'Sample'** (such as, gender: male or female) and **'Class'** (such as, preference of a colour: blue or pink ). In other words, you can check if gender has any influence on whether someone prefers the colour blue or pink.  



### Median test
The Median test can be interpreted as an application of the Fisher’s Exact test in a case where each observation is compared to the median of all the observations. Therefore, the Fisher's Exact test is applied to the following 2x2 contingency table with the *'Class'* constructed by comparison of each observation to the median of both independent samples.

|             |      **≤ Median**         | **> Median** |               |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Sample 1**|     A          |     B        | A + B    |
| **Sample 2**  | C       | D          |  C + D    |
|              | A + C          | B + D      |    N = A + B + C + D    |


Because an ordering of data is required to accurately define the median, it is important to have an **ordinal** data to use this test.




### Mann-Whitney U test
Another test that is suitable for an **ordinal** and **continuous** data is the Mann-Whitney U test. This is the most widely used non-
parametric test and the non-parametric alternative to Student's t-test.

You can use this test when you have two independent groups (samples) and you want to know if there is a significant difference in the distribution or median of a variable between these groups.
For example: Are the median test scores of students who received Tutoring Group A significantly different from those who received Tutoring Group B?



{{% summary %}}

- Non parametric tests are important because parametric tests like the t-test and f-test make certain assumptions about the underlying population distribution which are not always reasonable to make.

- The choice of the non-parametric test depends on 3 characteristics of your data:
   - Measurement scale: Nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio scale
   - Type of data: binary, discrete or continuous
   - Data structure: One sample, dependent or independent samples
