# Introducting Tilburg.ai

In a changing educational landscape influenced by AI, we're thrilled to share our latest project with you â€“ [Tilburg.ai](https//tilburg.ai)! Over the past few weeks, a students and faculty members from Tilburg Science Hub have been working behind the scenes on this new blog.
 
## Exploring the Possibilities

We started by asking a simple but profound question: How can AI enhance education? At Tilburg.ai, we want to answer this question. Here, you can explore innovative ways to integrate AI into the classroom and stay updated on the evolving needs of educators and learners.

The website covers all different kinds of blogs highlighting __tutorials__ and __use cases for effectively using ChatGPT__ and __other AI tools in education__. We provide insights from both students and teaching faculty.

## Behind the Scenes

Tilburg.ai is currently curated by the "AI in education" working group, led by TiSEM's Vice Dean of Education, and supported by two student assistants of Tilburg Science Hub, Jonas and Matthijs. The coordination is overseen by Associate Professor Hannes Datta, who is also a member of the Tilburg Science Hub team.
