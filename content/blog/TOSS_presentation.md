## **Exploring Open Science with Tilburg Science Hub at the 'Open to Complexity' Symposium** ##

Last month, we had the opportunity to showcase Tilburg Science Hub at the "Open to Complexity: Symposium on Open Science in the Social Sciences and Humanities" in Tilburg. 

This event was all about the growing appreciation for Open Science. As more and more disciplines understand what this means in practice, the question arises whether Open Science can also be applied in fields that are not directly connected to hypotheses, confirmatory statistics and formulas.
We proposed concrete and practical ways to open up research responsibly with our toolkit. 

### **Introducing Tilburg Science Hub**

Our presentation began with introducing Tilburg Science Hub to the audience as an open-source digital platform designed to simplify research. We shared our wealth of resources, including over 100 building blocks, 19 tutorials, and 8 examples, catering to both beginners and experts. 

### **Introducing Docker**

One of the tools we highlighted during our presentation is Docker, a powerful tool for collaboration and reproducibility. We shared a real-life scenario involving Sophie, a researcher facing challenges in reproducibility due to version compatibility issues. Docker allows researchers to encapsulate entire projects and dependencies into a portable, self-sufficient container. This guarantees consistency and simplifies collaboration.

### **Introducing Other Concepts**

Our presentation didn't end at Docker. We also introduced a new concept to the audience: the concept of using cloud computers. In our story, Sophie attracted a global collaborator, Mike, who needed more computational power. Tilburg Science Hub introduced the concept of using cloud computers and deploying containerized projects within them.

To conclude our presentation, we emphasized that Tilburg Science Hub extends beyond Docker. We offer a comprehensive toolkit that covers everything from data collection and analysis to version control. Our platform fosters simplicity, clarity, and transparency in research.
