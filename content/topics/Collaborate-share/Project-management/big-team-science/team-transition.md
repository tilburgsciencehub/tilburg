## Overview

Open Science practices can boost your enjoyment and productivity when working on empirical research projects. Yet, imagine not only you but also other members of your department and school using similar tools and methods to collaborate.

Luckily, you don't have to reinvent the wheel and can follow the best practices of leading research groups.
