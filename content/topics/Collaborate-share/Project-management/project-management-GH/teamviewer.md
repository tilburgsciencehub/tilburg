## What is Teamviewer

TeamViewer is a software application that facilitates remote access, desktop sharing, online meetings, and collaboration tools. With TeamViewer, users can connect to and control computers and devices remotely over the internet, making it valuable for technical support, troubleshooting, file sharing, and communication among users who work remotely.

This capability is especially significant when it comes to obtaining feedback on code or resolving technical issues, which are vital for enhancing your learning experience. When working remotely, you can leverage the power of **TeamViewer**. It empowers team members to *remotely control* your computer, enabling immediate assistance and collaboration to address your needs effectively.

## Installing Teamviewer

To install TeamViewer, go to the [TeamViewer homepage](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/) and download the installer for your operating system.
We recommend you to install Teamviewer *permanently*. If you do not have administrator rights, it's fine to only select *run once*.

Please indicate you download Teamviewer for *private use*, unless your organization provides you with a site license.

**Mac users need to change additional security settings.**
After installing TeamViewer, Mac users need to change a few security settings to grant access rights so that a team member may steer your mouse and type on your keyboard. Please [follow this guide](https://community.teamviewer.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-control-a-Mac-running-macOS-10-14-or-higher/ta-p/44699#toc-hId--1220346050).
