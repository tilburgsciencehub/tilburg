## Installation

The first step is to setup a {{< katex >}}\TeX{{< /katex >}} distribution on your machine.

1. If you haven't done it yet, you can read **[our guide](/get/latex)** on how to install $\LaTeX$:

{{% cta-primary-center "How to Install $\LaTeX$" "/get/latex" %}}

2. Once you've installed it, you'll need a text editor to work with. We recommend **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**, a free text editor with great functions and extensions. You can download VS Code from its official website or read the instructions from [our Building Block](/get/VSCode). Another great online text editor is [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). Overleaf provides nice collaboration tools, and it can be used online without any setup needed.

3. The last piece of the puzzle: let's setup VS Code so that it can run $\LaTeX$. Install the VS Code extension `LaTeX Workshop`. This extension provides all-in-one features and utilities for $\LaTeX$ typesetting, making it a comprehensive tool for editing, compiling, and previewing $\LaTeX$ documents. 
    
## Setup

Before starting to write anything, let's setup a directory for this project.

Make a new folder wherever you prefer on your local disk. Then launch VS Code, create a new file, and save it with a `.tex` file extension in said folder.

You're finally ready to start writing your first $\LaTeX$ document!
