## Overview

Welcome to this building block dedicated to LaTeX and Lyx, where we equip you with the essential tools to create professional research papers and captivating presentations. First, we introduce you to LaTeX and LyX. Then, we provide LyX templates for research papers and presentation slides.

## LaTeX

[{{< katex >}}\LaTeX{{< /katex >}}](https://www.latex-project.org) is a professional typesetting system widely used in academia. It produces great-looking journal articles, technical reports, books, and even slide presentations.

One of its main features is that **it separates the writing and the formatting stages**. The writer can focus solely on writing the content in plain text, and then use some markup tags and commands to stylize the text and define the document structure.

This is mainly what sets $\LaTeX$ apart from WYSIWYG (an acronym for "What You See Is What You Get") editors, like Microsoft Word. Experienced users can produce professional-looking documents very quickly but at the expense of losing a Graphical User Interface.

## LyX: Where Form Meets Function

**[LyX](https://www.lyx.org)** is a document preparation software that bridges the gap between "What You See Is What You Mean" and "What You See Is What You Get". It combines the power and flexibility of $\LaTeX$ with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface and the gentle learning curve of editors like Microsoft Word.

LyX is cross-platform and free of charge. You can download it from the **[LyX Download page](https://www.lyx.org/Download)**.
