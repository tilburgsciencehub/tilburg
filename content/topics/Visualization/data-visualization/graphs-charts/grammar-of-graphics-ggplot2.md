## Overview

In this article, we will explore the inner workings of `ggplot2`, a powerful package for creating data visualisations in R. We will zoom in on the core principle of `ggplot2`, known as the "Grammar of Graphics".  This concept views a plot as a composition of distinct, independent layers. 

We will provide practical examples to illustrate these concepts, starting with creating a basic plot and gradually introducing colour, size, layering geoms, refining aesthetics, incorporating facets for multi-dimensional analysis, and adding labels and annotations.

By the end of this building block, you'll have a solid understanding of `ggplot2`'s modularity, layering, and best practices, empowering you to craft compelling data visualizations and stories.

## Grammar of Graphics

Creating a graph in R using `ggplot2` can be thought of as building a sentence. Just as words form clear sentences, `ggplot2` combines graphical elements guided by the "Grammar of Graphics". Like using basic parts of speech to build sentences, `ggplot2` employs points, lines, and colors as fundamental components for flexible and meaningful data visualization.  

The term "`gg`" in `ggplot2` stands for "Grammar of Graphics", reflecting its core philosophy. Plots are constructed through a series of layers, each appended with the `+` operator. While initially, this approach may seem less intuitive than generating a plot with a single function call, it's precisely this layer-by-layer construction that grants `ggplot2` its versatility. This methodology enables you to build a wide range of plots, from simple bar charts to complex multi-layered visualizations.

Imagine you're painting a picture; you start with a sketch (your dataset) and then add layers of paint (aesthetics and geoms). Each stroke of the brush (layer) enriches your painting (plot), making it more detailed and colorful. This is the essence of `ggplot2`'s layering. You build plots layer by layer, each adding new dimensions to your data story.

## Basic Ingredients of a `ggplot`:

### The `ggplot()` function  
   
Every visualization with the `ggplot2` package starts with the `ggplot()` function, where you specify the dataset and set up aesthetics (aes) that map data variables to visual properties. These mappings variables define how data variables are represented in terms of visual properties such as axes, colors, shapes, and sizes.

{{% codeblock %}}

```R
# install package `ggplot2`
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# Creating the stage
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) 
```

</p>

{{% example %}}

This code initializes a ggplot object for a plot, using the `mpg` dataset with engine displacement (displ) and highway miles per gallon (hwy). In our analogy to constructing sentences, we've set the stage, but the plot remains empty, much like a sentence without verbs or adjectives. To bring it to life, we need to call upon a `geom()` function to specify the type of plot we want to create.

{{% /example %}}

### Geometric Objects (`geoms`): 

The next step involves adding one or more geometric objects, or `geoms`. Geoms determine the type of plot you're creating. Whether it's a bar plot (`geom_bar`), a line plot (`geom_line`), a scatter plot (`geom_point`), or any other graphical representation, each geom layer takes the foundational setup from the ggplot call and visually interprets the data according to its type.

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +

### Aesthetic Layering in `ggplot2`
In `ggplot2`, layering aesthetics, like color and fill, is crucial for creating a detailed and visually appealing visualization. However, to make the most of this capability, it's essential to grasp two fundamental aspects of the `ggplot2` language:

**Aesthetic Inheritance**: In `ggplot2`, aesthetics applied in the `ggplot()` fucntion initially flow through all layers, ensuring consistency, but be cautious to avoid unintended changes in later layers. 

**Overwriting Aesthetics**: Adding new layers to your plot introduces the potential for overwriting the aesthetic settings of previous layers. Therefore, be mindful of how each layer affects the overall aesthetics of the visualization to achieve your intended design.

#### Aesthetic Inheritance in Layering
Aesthetics defined in the initial `ggplot()` function serve as a base layer and are inherited by subsequent layers. This feature enables a consistent application of aesthetics like color or fill across the entire plot unless specifically overridden in subsequent layers. For instance:

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(aes(color = class))  # Only affects geom_smooth layer
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/gginheritance.png" width="350">
</p>

{{% example %}}

Here, the color aesthetic applied to the geom_smooth layer does not affect the geom_point layer, illustrating how layer-specific aesthetic settings can override the base layer settings.

{{% /example %}}

#### Overwriting Aesthetics with New Layers
In `ggplot2`, aesthetics set in the ggplot() function serve as global settings for the entire plot, while aesthetics set in a `geom_()` function apply only to that specific layer. This can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully.

Therefore, when adding new layers, be cautious as they can overwrite the aesthetic settings from earlier layers. This is particularly relevant when youâ€™re incrementally building a plot and want to maintain certain aesthetic features throughout. For example:


{{% codeblock %}}

```R
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = "red"), size = 3)
```

{{% /codeblock %}}

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/ggoverwriting.png" width="450">
</p>

{{% example %}}

In this example, the first `geom_point() ` layer uses the global aesthetic defined in ggplot(), coloring points by the class variable. However, when the second geom_point() layer is added with color = "red", it overwrites the color for all points, making them red, regardless of their class.

**Best Practices for Layering Aesthetics**
To effectively use layering in `ggplot2`:
- *Be Consistent*: Maintain a consistent theme across layers for a cohesive story.
- *Plan Your Layers*: Think ahead about how each layer contributes to your plot.
- *Simplify*: Avoid overcomplicating your plot. Sometimes, less is more.
- *Use Comments*: Annotate your code with comments for better understanding and readability.
- *Visualize Progress*: Check the output of your plot as you add layers.

## Practical Example
Every `ggplot2` visualization starts with a foundational layer. This initial step involves defining the dataset and basic aesthetics.

#### Step 1: Creating a Basic Plot

{{% codeblock %}}

```R
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

{{% /codeblock %}}

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/ggplotexample1.png" width="450">
</p>

*Description*: Starting with a basic scatter plot using the 'mpg' dataset. This foundational plot maps engine displacement (displ) to the x-axis and highway miles per gallon (hwy) to the y-axis. It's a simple yet effective way to visualize the relationship between these two variables.

#### Step 2: Introducing Color and Size
Adding color and size to a plot can significantly enhance its interpretability and appeal.

{{% codeblock %}}

```R
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = manufacturer, size = cyl)) + 
  geom_point()
```

{{% /codeblock %}}

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/ggplotexample2.png" width="450">
</p>

*Insight*: By introducing color and size, we differentiate data points by manufacturer and cylinder count. This addition turns a simple scatter plot into a more detailed and informative visualization, highlighting multiple variables at once.

#### Step 3: Layering Geoms
Different geometrical shapes, or 'geoms', can be layered to present data in various formats, such as lines, bars, or points.

{{% codeblock %}}

```R
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```

{{% /codeblock %}}

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/ggplotexample3.png" width="450">
</p>

*Analysis*: Adding a smooth line (geom_smooth) to our scatter plot provides an overview of the general trend. This layer helps in visualizing the relationship between displacement and highway MPG across different vehicle segments.


#### Step 4: Refining Aesthetics, Adjusting Scales and Themes
Fine-tuning scales and applying themes can transform the appearance and readability of a plot.

{{% codeblock %}}

```R
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = manufacturer, size = cyl)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    scale_color_brewer(type = "qual") +
    theme_minimal()
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/ggplotexample4.png" width="450">
</p>

*Explanation*: The use of `scale_color_brewer(type = "qual")` adds a qualitative palette from Color Brewer, ideal for differentiating categories like manufacturers. Following this, `theme_minimal()` creates a cleaner, less cluttered look, highlighting the data. These enhancements improve the plot's visual appeal and clarity, making it more engaging and easier to interpret.

#### Step 5: Incorporating Facets for Multi-Dimensional Analysis
Faceting in `ggplot2` creates a grid of related plots, each representing a different slice of the data, allowing for an effective comparison across categorical variables.

{{% codeblock %}}

```R
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = manufacturer)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    facet_wrap(~class)
```

{{% /codeblock %}}

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/ggplotexample5.png" width="450">
</p>

*Context*: Faceting based on vehicle class creates a grid of plots, each focusing on a different class. This approach allows for a more granular analysis, enabling comparisons across different vehicle categories.

#### Step 6: Final Touches, Adding Labels and Annotations
Labels and annotations bring clarity and context to a plot, making it more informative and reader-friendly.

{{% codeblock %}}

```R
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = manufacturer)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    labs(title = "Engine Displacement vs. Highway MPG",
         x = "Engine Displacement (L)",
         y = "Highway Miles per Gallon",
         color = "Manufacturer") +
    theme_minimal()
```

{{% /codeblock %}}

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/ggplotexample6.png" width="450">
</p>

*Detailing*: The final step involves adding informative labels and annotations. A clear title, axis labels, and a legend make the plot self-explanatory. These finishing touches ensure the plot communicates effectively with its audience.
