**How to set up Sublime Text for Python**
 
Sublime Text can be enhanced with packages to support Python programming. Follow these steps to configure Sublime Text for Python development:

1. Install Python on your computer. If you haven't already, you can use our [Set up Python](/get/python) guide to install Python. Verify the installation by running `python --version` in your Command Prompt. If it is correctly installed, it should return the Python version.

2. Install `Package Control` in Sublime Text. 

`Package Control` is a package manager, which can be used for the installation of extensions. To install it, open Sublime Text and go to the "Command Palette" (under the "Tools" menu) or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+P`(macOS). Type "Install Package Control" and select it from the options.

When successfully installed, the following message will pop-up as a confirmation:

3. Install a package to execute Python code. The `Terminus` package is a popular choice, it brings a terminal as a window in Sublime Text.

A few alternatives to consider are `SublimeREPL`, which provides a REPL interface, or `Sublime-Jupyter` which allows you to work with Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) directly within Sublime Text. To install any of these packages, open the "Command Palette" again, type "Package Control: Install Package", and search for the desired package.

4. To execute Python code, use the `Ctrl+B` (Windows) /`Cmd+B` (macOS) shortcut or go to "Tools" > "Build". The output will be displayed in the Sublime Text built-in terminal.
