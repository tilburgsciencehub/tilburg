## What are Stata packages 

Stata packages are user-contributed programs or commands that expand the capabilities of the Stata statistical software. They provide additional tools for tasks like data analysis, econometrics, and visualization, enhancing Stata's built-in features.

## Installing Stata packages from SSC

Installing packages from SSC is straight forward. For example if you wish to install `egenemore` package:

{{% codeblock %}}
```
-Stata-
ssc install egenmore
```
{{% /codeblock %}}


### Installing community-contributed packages

While packages are regularly being added to SSC, in some cases you may need a package that has not been yet added but is available online. For example using `rdmulti` package for [regression discontinuity estimation](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/analyze-data/regressions/impact-evaluation).

{{% codeblock %}}
```
-Stata-
net install rdmulti, from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdpackages/rdmulti/master/stata) replace
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

If you are searching for the package but are unsure how to get the correct path; or alternatively if you are searching for packages that can help you in some specific application, the `search` command comes in handy.

{{% codeblock %}}
```
-Stata-
search rdmulti
* Helps you find the installation path for rdmulti

search venn
* Lists packages that may be helpful for producing Venn diagrams
```
{{% /codeblock %}}


### Installing packages from .ado files

If you wish to manually install a package using an .ado file, for example using work from a colleague that may not be available online you should just copy the ado file into your personal ado folder. To find the path for your personal folder, use either `sysdir` or `personal`.

{{% codeblock %}}
```
-Stata-
sysdir
* Provides different system directories, including personal ado folder

personal
* Provides path to personal ado folder
```
{{% /codeblock %}}
