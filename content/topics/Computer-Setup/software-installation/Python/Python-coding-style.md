#### PEP 8
We follow Python's style guide [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations). Also we:

* Use docstrings for functions whose purpose may be unclear or that will be used outside of their own modules

#### Supplemental resources:

* [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/), especially the sections on [coding style](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/) and [packaging conventions](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/).

* [Google's Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html), especially recommendations concerning [string formatting](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Strings) and the rule to always explicitly close [files and sockets](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Files_and_Sockets#Files_and_Sockets).

Additional notes:

* When opening text files for writing or appending text, use [`open`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html)'s option `mode = "wb"` or `mode  =  "ab"` respectively to  write in binary mode. This improves portability across operating systems.

* When opening text files for reading, use [`open`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html)'s option `mode = "rU"` to enable universal newline support.
