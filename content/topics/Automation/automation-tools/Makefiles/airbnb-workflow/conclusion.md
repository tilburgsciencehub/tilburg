# Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to leverage Inside Airbnb data to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Airbnb market in Amsterdam. We walked through the step-by-step process of downloading, cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the data, enabling us to gain insights into reviews per neighborhood.

**Final exercise**: Study the output files and formulate an answer to our initial research question as well as the following subquestions.

**Main Research Question:** _How did the Airbnb market in Amsterdam respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of bookings per neighborhood?_

**Subquestions**:
* Did all neighbourhoods in Amsterdam suffer equally from the pandemic?
* Why is the number of listings in December 2020 remarkably low?
* Discuss the methods you can use to test whether the identified relationship is statistically significant. How would you define the regression model? (no need to implement it here!)
* Comment on the limitations of our approach and come up with strategies to overcome them.

To supplement this tutorial, we have developed a [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/tilburgsciencehub/inside-airbnb-tutorial) that includes the complete code necessary to replicate our findings on analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on the Airbnb market in Amsterdam using Inside Airbnb data. This allows you to compare our approach with your own and gain insights for further analysis. Happy exploring!
