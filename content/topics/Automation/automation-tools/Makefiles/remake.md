# Overview

[`Make`](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/learn/makefiles/?utm_campaign=referral-short) is a useful tool for automating the execution of scripts and managing datasets in a complex project. However, diagnosing errors in the workflow can be challenging with `make`. To address this issue, the debugger `remake` can be used to provide extensive error information, facilitating the debugging process and helping to ensure that the project runs smoothly.

Hence, in this building block, you will:

- Learn how to install and run `remake`.
- Understand the importance of `remake` in debugging `makefiles`.
- Get hands-on with debugging sessions, setting breakpoints, and error tracing.

# Steps to debugging


To illustrate the steps to debugging with `remake` we will use an example workflow with the following directory structure. 

To immerse yourself in hands-on learning, feel free to clone the provided repository to your local machine and follow along with our example:

{{% cta-primary-center "Go to the GitHub Repository now" "https://github.com/srosh2000/airbnb_superhost" %}}

```bash
├── Airbnb data.Rproj
├── README.md
├── data
│   └── listings.csv
├── gen
│   ├── output
│   │   ├── ordinary_hosts.html
│   │   ├── plot_nrreviews.png
│   │   ├── plot_rating.png
│   │   ├── review_IR.html
│   │   ├── review_IR2.htm
│   │   ├── review_model.html
│   │   ├── super_hosts.html
│   │   ├── tobit1.html
│   │   └── tobit2.html
│   └── temp
│       ├── cleaned_listings.csv
│       └── cleaned_listings1.csv
├── makefile
├── report
│   ├── report.Rmd
│   └── report.html
└── src
    ├── analysis
    │   ├── Rplots.pdf
    │   ├── analysis.R
    │   └── makefile
    └── data-preparation
        ├── cleaning.R
        ├── download_data.R
        └── makefile
```

Suppose the files `cleaned_listings.csv` and `cleaned_listings1.csv` were created after running the `cleaning.R` script were not saved in the temp folder. The files in the output folder are dependent on these files in the temp folder which will result in an error while executing `make`.

**Here are the key steps we will take you through to debug using `remake`:**

* Install `remake`
* Run `remake`
* Use the `remake --trace` command to run the `remake` tool with tracing enabled for more details on how each rule in your `makefile` is executed.
* Set breakpoints using the `continue` or `break` command to pause the execution of your `makefile` at specific points to debug.

Now, let's get started!

## Installing remake

### Debian/Ubuntu

On Debian systems, `remake` can be installed by running:

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install remake
```
{{% /codeblock %}}


### MacOSX

On OSX systems, it can be installed from Homebrew or [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/remake/details/).

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
$ brew install remake

```
{{% /codeblock %}}

{{% tip %}}

Haven't installed Homebrew yet? Check out our [building block](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/configure/cli/?utm_campaign=referral-short) to set it up!

### Windows

For Windows users, installing `remake` for debugging `Makefiles` requires some additional steps, as `remake` is primarily designed for Unix-like operating systems.


**1) Install a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):**

WSL allows you to run a Linux distribution alongside your existing Windows installation. 

[Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/search/explore?q=ubuntu) is one of the most common ones, go to the Microsoft Store here, install it and launch it, and you'll be running a Linux shell on your Windows machine.


**2) Update your Linux Distribution:**

Run the following commands in your Linux shell:

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

```
{{% /codeblock %}}

**3) Install `remake`:**

Now you can install `remake` as explained before for Ubuntu/Debian systems.


**4) Access your project files:**

In WSL, your Windows file system is mounted under `/mnt/`. So, for instance, if you have files on your `C` drive, they will be accessible under `/mnt/c/`.

Navigate to your project's directory (which is in your Windows filesystem) from within WSL. For example, if your project is in C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects, you can access it in WSL with:

```
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/Projects/

```
## Tracing

When you run `make`, it simply spots the error without further information on how the target needs to be updated but we might get more information by consulting the rules for the target.

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/make.png" width="700">
<figcaption> Error output after running make </figcaption>
</p>

Now let us run `remake`:

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/remake.png" width="700">
<figcaption> Error output after running remake </figcaption>
</p>

This displays additional information. We get the line number inside the `Makefile` for target ***analysis (6)*** and the target that got us to this one.

For further traceback information, run:

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
remake --trace analysis

```
{{% /codeblock %}}

Or, without the target name:

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
remake --trace

```
{{% /codeblock %}}


<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/trace.png" width="900">
<figcaption> Tracing output </figcaption>
</p>

The indentation in the first few lines containing file name and line numbers gives target level nesting. The target ***data-preparation*** was asked to be remade because it is a dependency of target ***analysis*** Thus, we get the dependency nesting as build and traverse the tree.

Finally, we also get details on the scripts that were run to build the target ***data-preparation***. This tells us to check the `cleaning.R` script for bugs.

Run `remake -n` to see the sequence of steps that will be run to execute the workflow without actually running it.

## Entering the Debugger and Setting Breakpoints
The simple tracing method explained above is sometimes enough but we could also work with the built-in debugger which contains some useful commands for more efficient debugging.

Run `remake --debugger` , `remake -X` or `remake --debugger analysis` (with a specific target name, here: analysis) to enter the debugger.


<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/remake-x.png" width="600">
<figcaption> Initiating debugger session </figcaption>
</p>

It first checks whether the Makefile itself is up to date. Now that we have initiated the debugger we can set a breakpoint and run until the dependent target. The debugger assigns a number to each breakpoint created. We could also set a breakpoint using a line number instead of a target name.  Both `continue` and `break` commands can be used to set breakpoints.

For a given target, there are three main stopping points:

- Before target prerequisite checking: prereq
- After target prerequisite checking but before running commands: run
- After target is complete: end

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../images/breakpoint.png" width="800">
<figcaption> Setting breakpoint </figcaption>
</p>

Adding `run` to the end of `continue data-preparation` causes the debugger to stop after dependency checking. This is the default option. Previously, the debugger stopped *before* dependency checking , as shown by the icon `->`, so it lists the dependencies for the target. 

Here, the dependency for the target ‘analysis’ was ‘data-preparation’. Later, the debugger stopped *after* dependency checking, as shown by the `..` icon rather than `->`.

Furthermore, you can run `break` to get a list of all breakpoints. To delete breakpoints, run `delete` with the breakpoint number.

Additionally, once you enter the debugger the `backtrace` command comes in handy to trace the root of the error.

Lastly, to exit the debugger session simply run `quit`.

{{% tip %}}
**The following changes have been made to GNU Make to improve tracing and error reporting with remake**:

* The `Makefile` name and the line inside this file are reported when referring to a *target*.
* A list of relevant targets with their *locations* is shown in the error message.
* The command invocation used to run `make` is also shown.
* There are useful options that allow for entering the debugger on error.
