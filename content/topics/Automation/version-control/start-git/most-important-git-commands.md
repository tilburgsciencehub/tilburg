## Overview

This is a summary of the most important Git commands that you can use in Git Bash. If you're not so familiar with working in the command prompt/terminal, you could also try to check out Git Desktop or Git GUI, which provides a graphical user interface for performing the Git workflow.

The building block consists of the following sections:
- The most important Git commands
- Advanced use cases
  - Add all files to the staging area
  - Ignore files from versioning
  - Undo previous commits

## The most important Git commands

Clone ("download") the repository to your computer.

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
git clone <URL>
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

{{% warning %}}
Do not clone a repository into another repository!
{{% /warning %}}

---

Check which files/directories have changed since your last commit.

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
git status
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

---

Add specified file(s) to the staging area, so that any changes can eventually be committed.

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
git add <file_name>
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

---

Commit staged changes to the version history of your repository. 

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
git commit -m "<your_message>"
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

{{% tip %}}
It's good practice to use a clear & concise commit message ("note to your future self and others") which shows up prominently on your repository at GitHub.com.
{{% /tip %}}

---

Push any changes you have done to the repository on your computer to the specified branch of the remote repository (e.g., at GitHub.com).

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

---

View your commit history (i.e., a list of commit IDs and your commit messages).

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
git log
```
{{% /codeblock %}}


## Advanced use cases

### Add all files to the staging area

To add all files that have been changed to the staging area (to eventually commit them), use `git add .`. That way, you don't have to mention files individually.

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
git add .
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

{{% warning %}}
Beware to not accidentally version files that must not be versioned (e.g., datasets) when using `git add .`.
{{% /warning %}}


### Ignore files from versioning

You can create a `.gitignore` file (e.g., in the root directory of your repository) to tell Git to stop paying attention to files you don't want to version (e.g., datasets, operation-specific files like Mac's `.DS_Store` or R's `.RHistory`.

For example, if you save the snippet below in a file called `.gitignore`, any content in the `my_passwords` folder and any `.csv` files will be ignored - even when using `git add .`!

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
  my_passwords/*
  *.csv
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

---

### Undo previous commits

It happens to all of us - we sometimes commit stuff that we didn't mean to commit. That can be quite problematic, for example, if you've accidentally committed a password. But even for less drastic cases, reverting "wrong" commits is good practice because it keeps your repository clean.

The snippet below undoes the last commit.

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

Alternatively, you can view the commit history with `git log`, and revert to *any* commit by referring to its unique id (which looks a bit like this: `0hf1u7x2`).

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
git reset --hard <commit id>
```
{{% /codeblock %}}
