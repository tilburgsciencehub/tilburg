## Overview

Projects boards on GitHub help you organize and prioritize your work using the [Scrum framework for project management](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/learn/scrum). The benefit from project boards is that you can link your repositories. This way all issues that are related to different projects can be organized in a unique project board.

This building block will help you navigate the initial steps to establish your project board with GitHub Projects.

## Creating your GitHub project board

- On your profile page on GitHub, you can find a tab “Projects” that enables you to view all your current projects board and make a “New Project”, for instance:

  ![Projects](../images/projects.png)

- Provide a name and a description for your project

- Set “Basic Kanban” as your project board template:

  ![kanban](../images/basicKanban.png)

  The “Basic Kanban” template ensures that you have almost all necessary columns to work using the Scrum framework.

- Link the repositories that are associated with your project. You can always add repositories to your project later on.  

- After creating the project board, ensure that you  **add the “Backlog” column**.

__Collaborative workflow__
- **Sharing your project board:** Share your project board with your team members. Click on settings to add collaborators. 

- **Admin rights for collaborators:** Give these collaborators admin rights so that they can create issues, rename issues and prioritize issues as you go along.
