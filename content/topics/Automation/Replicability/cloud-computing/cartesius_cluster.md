## SURFsara's Cartesius Cluster: Overview

Cartesius is a supercomputer in the true sense of the word. All servers in the cluster are linked with high-speed connections to form a very large computer. Cartesius is best suited for calculations in which the individual components (functions and procedures) have a great interdependence.
A so-called Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) is also offered in this environment. In some cases, for example with Floating Point calculations, running a program on a Graphics adapter is much more efficient than on a computer processor.

### Pros
- The most rapid solution.
- Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) available.
- A huge amount of software.
- Users do not have to share resources but have exclusive access.

### Cons
- Steep learning curve. Knowledge is required to be able to build an efficient job.
- No direct access to the joint network of Tilburg University.
- There may be a queue and thus waiting time.
- Less interactive because of the queue principle.
