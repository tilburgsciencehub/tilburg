      <description>Overview Many R-users rely on the dplyr or read.table packages to import their datasets as a dataframe. Although this works well for relatively small datasets, we recommend using the data.table R package instead because it is significantly faster. This building block provides you with some practical tips for dealing with large datsets in R.
Code As a starting point, make sure to clean your working environment in RStudio. Oftentimes, there are datasets stored memory that you have worked with earlier but you&amp;rsquo;re no longer using.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a handy function that can be used to clean social media data scraped from the web.
Usually, when scraping social media, the output data can contain letters like K&amp;rsquo;s (Thousands), M&amp;rsquo;s (Millions) and B&amp;rsquo;s (Billions). You are won&amp;rsquo;t be able to analyze them unless you first replace these letters with the appropriate zero digits.
Code # Function to convert textual social media counts to proper digits social_media_cleanup &amp;lt;- function(x) { if (class(x)%in%c(&amp;#39;integer&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;numeric&amp;#39;)) { warning(&amp;#39;Input is already numeric.</description>

      <description>The Data Preparation and Workflow Management course is an open-source Master level course taught at Tilburg University. All of its content is freely available and consists of lectures, live streams, self-study material, tutorials and examples.
This course teaches you how to engineer data sets for statistical analysis. Many students and researchers perceive the process of “creating” a data set for analysis as rather simplistic: a bit of cleaning here, a bit of merging there, and you’re done.</description>
