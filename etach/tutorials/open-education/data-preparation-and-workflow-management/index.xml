      <description>Overview The Data Preparation and Workflow Management course is an open-source Master level course taught at Tilburg University. All of its content is freely available and consists of lectures, live streams, self-study material, tutorials and examples.
This course teaches you how to engineer data sets for statistical analysis. Many students and researchers perceive the process of “creating” a data set for analysis as rather simplistic: a bit of cleaning here, a bit of merging there, and you’re done.</description>
